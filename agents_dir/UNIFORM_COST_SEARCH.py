    UNIFORM_COST_SEARCH LogAgent by Robert Parcus, 2014
    State space blind search using Uniform Cost Search.

    In standard breadth-Ô¨Årst search, we are always expanding nodes
    that are closest to the initial state in terms of the number 
    of actions in the path.

    But in Uniform Cost search we expand the nodes that are closest
    to the initial state in terms of the cost of their path.
    Consequently, nodes on the fringe will have approximately equal
    costs.

    It the cost of all actions is the same, Uniform Cost seach is
    equivalent to standard BFS.
    Uniform Cost search can be implemented by a queue that is
    ordered by means of the path cost function (lowest cost first).
