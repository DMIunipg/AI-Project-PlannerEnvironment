This module is tested on python 2.7.5 and 3.3.2.\r\n\r\n## Run the application\r\n\r\nYou can create your Agent in the *agents_dir*, like MyAgent example. The name of the file must be the same\r\nof the class that you create. The class must *inherit from LogAgent* and you have to implement the\r\nmethod *solve*.\r\n\r\nYou can put your configuration file in *cfg_dir*. These files must be with json extension and they must respect\r\nthe sintax of the environment, like in the examples that you can see in this directory.\r\n\r\nTo run the application simply execute the main.py file:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\npython main.py [-c cfg_list] [-a agents_list]\r\n```\r\n\r\n**NOTE**:\r\n* cfg_list is a list of configuration files names.\r\n* agents_list is a list of agents names.  \r\n\r\n*Example*: \r\n```bash\r\npython main.py -c testconfig_simple.json testconfig.json -a MyAgent\r\n```\r\n\r\n##Generating random maps\r\n\r\nThis module comes with a handy random map generator. The sysntax to use it is as follows:\r\n```bash\r\npython cfg_generator.py config_file_name num_airports num_airplanes num_boxes min_num_of_goals\r\n```\r\nThis command will create a `config_file_name.json` file under `\\cfg_dir`. There is no need to \r\nadd .json at the end of the file name.\r\n\r\nPlease note that `cfg_generator.py` will always overwrite files with the same name you enter.\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\nContributions are welcome, so please feel free to fix bugs, improve things, provide documentation. \r\nFor anything submit a personal message or fork the project to make a pull request and so on... thanks!\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n\r\nThis library is under heavily development, so there may be substantial changes in the near future.  \r\n\r\nYou can find an example of utilization of the module in this repo. Detailed instruction will be written soon.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\n[The MIT License (MIT)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DMIunipg/AI-Project-PlannerEnvironment/master/LICENSE)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
